   - Set up gradual efficiency decline pattern
   - Prepare failure prediction algorithms
   - Ready maintenance scheduling interface

2. **Demo Parameters**:
   ```
   System: ISS Oxygen Generation System (OGS)
   Current Efficiency: 87.3% (declining from 94.5%)
   Predicted Failure Window: 72 hours ± 8 hours
   Confidence Level: 96.8%
   Maintenance Window: Available in 24 hours
   ```

### **Demonstration Script**

**[Display Telemetry Monitoring Interface]**

> **Presenter**: "Predictive maintenance is crucial for space operations where equipment replacement isn't an option. Let me show you how our AI identifies potential failures before they become critical."

**[Show OGS Efficiency Trends]**
- Display 30-day efficiency trend graph
- Highlight subtle decline pattern
- Show AI anomaly detection trigger

> **Presenter**: "Here's telemetry from the ISS oxygen generation system over the past 30 days. While efficiency appears normal at 87%, our AI has detected a subtle decline pattern that indicates potential component failure within 72 hours."

**[Demonstrate Failure Prediction Analysis]**
- Show pattern recognition algorithms
- Display similar historical failure signatures
- Highlight confidence level calculation

> **Presenter**: "By comparing current patterns with historical failure signatures from similar systems, our AI achieves 96.8% confidence in this prediction. Traditional monitoring would likely miss this until efficiency dropped below 75%—too late for preventive action."

**[Show Automated Response Planning]**
- Display maintenance scheduling recommendations
- Show spare parts inventory check
- Highlight crew training requirements

> **Presenter**: "The system automatically schedules maintenance during the next available window, verifies spare parts availability, and even generates crew training materials for the specific repair procedure. This prevents the failure entirely rather than responding to it."

- 96.8% prediction accuracy
- Automated maintenance scheduling
- Prevention vs. reaction approach

### **Expected Audience Response**
- Understanding of sophisticated pattern recognition
