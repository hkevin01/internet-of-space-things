# Task
examine docs folder see what has not bee implmented from the plan.md and tracker. from there start implmenting those things into project, when coompleted update plan md files with current implmentation @Beast Mode - Strictly adhere to TaskSync Protocol. Monitor tasks.md file and apply Beast Mode workflow to each task: deep research, todo lists, rigorous testing, and autonomous completion. Documentation Verification: 

Read all files in /docs folder and list every goal, requirement, and specification mentioned 

Read the root README.md and list every feature, claim, and usage example 

Check for any TODO, FIXME, or WIP comments in documentation 

Verify all code examples in documentation actually work 

Ensure installation instructions are complete and accurate 

Check that all API endpoints/functions mentioned in docs exist in code 

Code-to-Documentation Alignment: 

Every feature mentioned in docs has corresponding implementation 

Every public function/API has documentation 

No undocumented features exist that should be mentioned 

Configuration options in code match what's documented 

Error messages in code match documented behavior 

Project Structure Verification: 

All files mentioned in documentation exist 

Directory structure matches what's described 

Dependencies listed in package files match what's imported 

No orphaned/unused files 

Build/compilation succeeds with documented steps 

Create Completion Verification Tests: 

Isbl  for example: 

Copy 

test_project_completion.py (or appropriate file) 
- test_all_documented_features_exist() 
- test_all_examples_in_readme_work() 
- test_all_project_goals_met() 
- test_installation_process() 
- test_all_documented_apis() 
- test_no_broken_imports() 
- test_all_config_options_work() 
- test_error_handling_as_documented() 
 

Generate Final Report: 

Json  for example: 

Copy 

PROJECT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md 
 
## Goals Achievement Status 
- [ ] Goal 1 from docs: [PASS/FAIL] - [reason] 
- [ ] Goal 2 from docs: [PASS/FAIL] - [reason] 
 
## README Claims Verification 
- [ ] Feature 1: [PASS/FAIL] - [test result] 
- [ ] Feature 2: [PASS/FAIL] - [test result] 
 
## Missing/Incomplete Items 
- List any features that don't work as documented 
- List any undocumented requirements found in code 
- List any broken examples 
 
## Recommendations 
- What needs to be fixed before project is truly complete 
- What documentation needs updating 
 

Edge Case Verification: 

Test with minimal configuration 

Test with maximum load/complexity mentioned in docs 

Test on fresh environment (no cached dependencies) 

Verify graceful degradation if optional features missing 

Output Required: 

Complete test suite that verifies project completeness 

Detailed report of what passes/fails 

List of specific items that need fixing 

Confirmation that project does everything claimed in documentation 

The goal is to ensure that someone who reads the documentation and uses the project will experience exactly what's promised, with no surprises or missing functionality.
